# Trial Assignment

## Your Task

- Log into your personal GitHub account (so that it can be linked to GitHub Classroom).
- Go to the assignment (https://classroom.github.com/a/SlwfD-f1) and accept it, and click the button to link your account. This is only done once, so if you linked your account to the classroom you won't have to do that again.
- Check out the assignment by cloning it to your local computer.
- Add an index.html (with a little content, maybe a heading), a CSS folder, and a CSS file with at least one style written in it.
- Add your changes to the staging area and ensure that the working tree is clean.
- Make a commit.
- Push that commit back up to GitHub classroom.

If you need help refer to the GitHub notes on Moodle.

**You will need to have this completed in order to gain access to assignment 1.**
